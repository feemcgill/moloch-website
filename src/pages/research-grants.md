## MolochDAO Research Grants

**Love to research and report your findings? **

Help MolochDAO make informed decisions when providing projects with funding and help developers make the most informed decisions when it comes to adopting a protocial, API, or design pattern.

**Seeking Unbiased Researchers**

Would you like to contribute to one of the seven research reports we have planned right now? If so, we can provide you with a $2,000 to $5,000 USD grant to produce that report within a 4 to 8 week period.

**Available Research Reports**

**Scaling Ethereum via L2**

Identify the teams and/or solutions that are most likely to succeed in scaling Ethereum in the near-term via L2. Which L2 technologies are best for different categories of applications like payments, DeFi, games, etc.? How can we improve L2 DevEx, UX, cross-L2 interoperability, and adoption? Assess how L2s can be used by developers as a privacy solution.

**Advancing Eth1.x**

This report will analyze Eth1.x ideas, proof of concepts, EIPs and identify roadblocks that are standing in the way of implementation, and highlight projects/ideas that may be ignored that should have more attention.

‍

**Privacy Options for Ethereum Clients**

This report will analyze potential solutions for adding network-level privacy in Ethereum clients such as using Tor or a mixnet. The technical challenges, advantages, and disadvantages of various options should be explored, as well as whether they differ between Eth1 and Eth2.

‍

**Privacy UX**

There are many tools / DeFi apps in Ethereum that can be slightly modified to be more privacy preserving. What are current privacy anti-patterns that should be avoided? [e.g. Right now there is a pattern where you are asked to log in with your accounts vs. asking which accounts to track.]. Define greatest UX pain points in creating privacy preserving dapps and potential compromises that can be made to achieve the best of both worlds.

**Privacy inside the Ethereum Ecosystem**

Technologies and teams that are at the cutting edge of enabling private applications and private wallets on Ethereum.

**Privacy outside the Ethereum Ecosystem**

Privacy solutions being developed for other blockchain ecosystems, and what the Ethereum ecosystem can learn and apply.

**Novel means and best practices in application design for minimizing MEV (Miner Extractable Value) in DeFi applications.**

What should developers be thinking about? What are some of the easier changes that can be made to reduce MEV? What are some of the longer term solutions that will require further R&D?

**How To Get Funding**

Here’s a quick overview of the grant proposal process for research reports.

1. Get initial feedback from community members about your research report.
2. Jump on a video call to discuss your research report.
3. Submit a proposal on-chain through the DAOHaus platform.
4. Get more feedback about the research report before we commit to a grant.
