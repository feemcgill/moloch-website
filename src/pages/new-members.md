## New Members

**Welcome Mercenaries of MolochDAO**

Help beat the tragedy of the commons, with collective action for the public good.

**[[Launch App](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x1/0x519f9662798c2e07fbd5b30c1445602320c5cf5b)**] **[[Learn More](https://molochdao.gitbook.io/handbook/introduction/readme)]**

**Don’t Say We Didn’t Warn You**

MolochDAO is a grant giving decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where every member has voting power, as opposed to a small group of investors making all the decisions.

As a group of resilient optimists, who laugh in the face of Moloch and display battle scars with pride, members contribute their own capital to fund projects that further the development of public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem.

**[[Read Manifesto](https://molochdao.gitbook.io/handbook/vision-and-values/manifesto)]**

**We exist to eliminate societal patterns of optimizing for the individual at the cost of the collective.**

The demon, Moloch, prevents collective action, misaligning individual incentives with what is beneficial for all of humanity.

MolochDAO provides funding in the form of grants for digital public infrastructure. An individual’s cost to develop this infrastructure is disproportionate to how they will benefit from it, which is why members reject any intention for investment return.

In incentivizing coordination with grant funding, the DAO will slay the demon.
