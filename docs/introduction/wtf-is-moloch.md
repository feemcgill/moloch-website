# ü•© WTF is Moloch?

### Moloch is open-source

Moloch is a simple, open-source DAO framework. Its simplicity is important for 3 reasons:

1. Security (less code, less bugs)
2. Usability (complex tech but easiest to understand and use)
3. Extensibility (the ability to extend its functionality to meet evolving community needs).

For a brief introduction to DAOs and Molochs specifically, you can catch up via the [Moloch V2 Primer for Humans](https://medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455). The latest version of Moloch can be found [here](https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1).

Moloch was popularized due to its Minimum Viable DAO design and the advent of ‚Äúragequit‚Äù - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the treasury's assets.

The TL;DR of Moloch V2 is that it allows for an optimized treasury and new Proposal Types. Moloch V2 can hold a variety of ERC20 tokens, and allows for anyone (including those without shares) to make a proposal to the DAO.
