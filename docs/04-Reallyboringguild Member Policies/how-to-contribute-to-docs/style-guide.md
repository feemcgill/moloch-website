# Style Guide

**1. Structure**

All of the documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text-editor.

Here is a nice [CheatSheet](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/cheatsheet/#tables) for Markdown that you can use when making changes to the documentation.

If you like, another common tool we use in MolochDAO is [https://hackmd.io/](https://hackmd.io). If you prefer not to adopt the github flow, please share a hackmd with changes in #proof-of-work

We are using Github Issues to help bring contributors in, ensuring we uphold the integrity and quality of our documentation as we iterate.

**2. Grammar**

We use **US English** in our documentation

**3. Commonly troublesome words**

| Term          | What it refers to?                     | Not how we spell it |

| DAO           | Decentralised autonomous organisations | dao                 |

| UberHaus      | DAO of DAOs, governing DAOhaus         | Uberhaus            |

| ""            | _definition_                           | ""                  |
