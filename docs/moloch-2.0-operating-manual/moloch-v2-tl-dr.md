# Moloch v2 TL;DR

MolochDAO utilizes the Moloch V2 framework. A great overview of Moloch V2 and its benefits can be found [here](https://medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455).

Moloch was popularized due to its Minimum Viable DAO design and the advent of “ragequit” - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the Bank's assets.

The TL;DR of Moloch V2 is that it allows for an optimized DAO Bank and new Proposal Types. Moloch V2 can hold a variety of ERC20 tokens, and allows for anyone (including those without shares) to make a proposal to the DAO.
