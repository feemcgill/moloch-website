# Discord

You can join the Discord [here](https://discord.gg/bhqd3D6B).&#x20;

If you have been assigned a <mark style="color:red;">@MolochDAO Member</mark> role, then you will be able to access all of MolochDAO’s internal channels. If you have received a grant from the DAO in the form of shares but have not yet received your discord role, reach out to @traviswyche#2116 or @annwillmott#1682 to have your role updated.

If you haven't already introduced yourself, the first place you’ll want to make yourself known is #new-members - where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.
